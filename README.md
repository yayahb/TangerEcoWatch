# TangerEcowatch 🌍♻️

TangerEcowatch is an ASP.NET MVC project developed using Identity for user authentication. It aims to address the issue of inefficient waste management in Tangier by allowing residents to report overflowing trash cans directly to authorities.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Despite ongoing efforts, Tangier struggles with inefficient waste management, resulting in overflowing bins, littered streets, and environmental pollution. Inadequate infrastructure compounds the issue, making it challenging to handle the growing waste from the expanding population.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we propose the development of an app for residents in Tangier to report overflowing trash cans directly to authorities. This app will enable citizens to identify areas with excessive garbage buildup and notify authorities instantly. By dispatching garbage collectors promptly to reported locations, this real-time reporting system will enhance waste collection efficiency, reduce overflowing bins, and contribute to cleaner streets and a healthier environment in Tangier.
